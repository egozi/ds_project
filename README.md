## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code is based on the `nba_api` package which is is an API Client for `www.nba.com`. This package intends to make the APIs of [NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/) easily accessible. `nba_api` requires Python 3.7+  and other required packages should be installed using:

> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project I was interesting in using NBA.com data to try and predict game results. The idea is to collect the performance of each team in all its previous matches and use it as predictors for the current fame results. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook that demonstrate the results of the proposed model for predicting NBA game results.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
